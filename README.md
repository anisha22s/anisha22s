### Hi there,  I'm Anisha :)

I'm a passionate Data Analyst and learner based in San Francisco ☀️

📚I recently finished my Master's in Business Analytics from UC Davis where I took courses in Advanced Statistics, Machine Learning, Data Management, Optimization, Big Data Analytics and Supply Chain Analytics. 

For my practicum, I engaged as a data analyst for a non profit where I led ETL and automation projects, assisted with building predictive models, built dashboard, recommended pricing strategies, conducted A/B testing and customer feedback text analysis. 

🌱I believe in lifelong learning and enjoy exploring new ideas and technologies to enhance my skills.
