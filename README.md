### Hi there,  I'm Anisha :)

I'm a passionate Data Analyst and learner based in San Francisco ☀️

📚I'm currently finishing my Master's in Business Analytics at UC Davis while taking courses like Big Data Analytics and Supply Chain Optimization. Additionallt, I am prepping for the AWS cloud certification.

I also work as a data analyst for a non profit performing arts center where I lead ETL and automation projects and also assist with pricing strategies, A/B testing and customer feedback sentiment analysis.

🌱I believe in lifelong learning and enjoy exploring new ideas and technologies to enhance my skills.
