### Hi there,  I'm Anisha :)

I'm a passionate Data Analyst and learner based in San Francisco ☀️

📚I'm currently finishing my Master's in Business Analytics at UC Davis while taking courses in Optimization, Big Data Analytics and Supply Chain Analytics. Additionally, I am prepping for the AWS cloud certification.

I also engage as a data analyst for a non profit performing arts center where I lead ETL and automation projects, and assist with building predictive models, recommend pricing strategies, A/B testing promotional offers and customer feedback sentiment analysis.

🌱I believe in lifelong learning and enjoy exploring new ideas and technologies to enhance my skills.
